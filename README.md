## Description

This project was motivated by a desire to push myself to make a node.js application that can build a professional website via prompts. This project allows organizations to quickly manage a team profile page so that contact and background info are available at a glance. This application allows the user to maintain their team with ease.

## Installation

To use this application, you will need to install inquirer npm in your terminal. Feel free to email me with any questions (contact info on GitHub).

## Usage

This app is intended to be used as a means of constructing a team profile page with ease.
